Moshi Mosh !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After one year working with the so called lightWeight UI language XML .
I escaped from the after effects of seeing huge lines of code and die out of boredom and 
after thinking silently I shifted to Jetpack COmpose which is an UI library aimed at reducing boiler plate code
increasing efficiency .


While I have built some react applications so I was able to relate 
much more that everyone wants the react way.


Bye bye so called 50 lines ka recycler View.
Things are just easy and simple ,and relatable ,forget the past come to Jetpack why i say so ,
because if some parts are easy other parts will eventually become tough.
